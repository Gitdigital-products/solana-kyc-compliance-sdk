Current Status Analysis

✅ What works well:

1. Login screen has clean enterprise aesthetics with proper form elements
2. Address detail has clear sections for basic info, notes, and audit trail
3. Dashboard shows essential table structure with filtering and bulk actions
4. All three cover the core acceptance criteria requirements

🔧 Minor improvements needed:

1. Dashboard table needs more realistic wallet address variety (currently shows duplicates)
2. Address detail could benefit from a document upload section
3. Missing navigation elements in the header

Here's how to structure these files:

/docs/registry-ui-wireframes/README.md

```markdown
# Compliance Registry Dashboard - Wireframes

## Core Screens

### 1. Login/Auth Screen
![Login Screen](./01-login-auth.jpeg)

**Purpose:** Secure authentication for compliance officers
- Email/password authentication
- "Remember me" functionality
- Forgot password flow
- Administrator contact information

### 2. Pending Approvals Dashboard  
![Dashboard](./02-pending-approvals.jpeg)

**Purpose:** Main interface for reviewing KYC submissions
- Search and filter capabilities
- Table view with wallet addresses, submission times, risk levels
- Bulk approve/reject actions
- Pagination for large datasets

### 3. Address Detail View
![Detail View](./03-address-detail.jpeg)

**Purpose:** Detailed review of individual submissions
- Full wallet address with copy functionality
- Basic KYC information (name, entity type, country)
- Risk assessment display
- Decision notes input
- Audit trail visibility

## Usage Notes
- These wireframes represent the MVP version
- All screens follow enterprise compliance software patterns
- Color coding for risk levels: ● High (Red), ● Medium (Yellow), ● Low (Green)
- Mobile-responsive design considerations are documented in `/docs/registry-requirements.md`

## Next Steps
1. Review with stakeholders for feedback
2. Create high-fidelity mockups based on these wireframes
3. Begin frontend implementation using React/TypeScript
```

Suggested File Renaming for Consistency

Rename your files to:

· copilot_image_1766503912775.jpeg → 01-login-auth.jpeg
· image_1766504112776.jpeg → 02-pending-approvals.jpeg
· image_1766504303723.jpeg → 03-address-detail.jpeg

Quick Enhancements You Could Request

If you want slightly improved versions, here are targeted prompts:

```markdown
**For Dashboard Table Fix:**
"Update the pending approvals wireframe table: replace duplicate '0x8a3f....c7d2' addresses with 4 unique wallet addresses like '0x4b92...e8a1', '0xf7c1...9b34', '0x2d8a...5f67', '0x9e3c...a8b2'. Add a user profile icon in top right corner."

**For Address Detail Enhancement:**
"Add a 'Documents' section to the address detail wireframe showing 3 document thumbnails labeled 'ID Front.jpg', 'ID Back.jpg', 'Proof of Address.pdf' and a 'View All' link. Move 'Audit Trail' to its own card."
```

Technical Implementation Notes

Based on these wireframes, here are key implementation details to add to your requirements:

1. Color Scheme Implementation:
   ```css
   /* Risk level colors */
   .risk-high { color: #dc2626; }    /* Red */
   .risk-medium { color: #d97706; }  /* Amber */
   .risk-low { color: #059669; }     /* Green */
   ```
2. Table Column Widths:
   · Wallet Address: 35%
   · Submitted: 25%
   · Risk: 15%
   · Days Pending: 10%
   · Checkbox: 5%
3. Responsive Breakpoints:
   · Desktop: > 1024px (table view)
   · Tablet: 768px-1024px (condensed table)
   · Mobile: < 768px (card view)

Are these wireframes acceptable for your MVP documentation? If so, I recommend:

1. Renaming the files as suggested above
2. Creating the README.md file
3. Proceeding with the technical implementation based on the requirements document
