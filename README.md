# Solana KYC Compliance SDK  
### by GitDigital Products

A production-ready **KYC & compliance SDK for the Solana ecosystem**, designed to help builders meet regulatory expectations **without centralizing trust or breaking decentralization**.

This SDK provides identity verification hooks, compliance workflows, and audit-ready logging while keeping developers in control of architecture and data flow.

---

## 🚀 What This Is

The **Solana KYC Compliance SDK** is a modular toolkit that enables:

- KYC / identity verification workflows
- Compliance-aware Solana program integration
- Audit logging and reporting
- Secure off-chain data handling
- Enterprise-grade reliability and resilience

It is built for:
- Web3 startups
- Regulated DeFi platforms
- Wallets, marketplaces, and payment rails
- Enterprises deploying on Solana

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **SDK, not custodian**  
  GitDigital Products does not custody user funds or act as a financial institution.

- **Compliance-aware, not compliance-blocking**  
  Integrates KYC/AML support without killing UX.

- **Blockchain-native**  
  Designed around Solana’s execution model, RPC dependencies, and ecosystem realities.

- **Audit-ready by default**  
  Logging, controls, and documentation are first-class citizens.
