Subject: Solving the compliance bottleneck for [Project Name]’s RWA launch
Hi [Richard Kindler],
I’ve been following [Project Name] and your recent move into [specific asset class, e.g., tokenized treasuries/real estate].
As Solana RWA TVL pushes past $1.6B, the biggest hurdle for institutional scaling is no longer liquidity—it’s automated enforcement. Most projects are still using manual whitelists, which creates significant legal lag and scaling friction.
I’ve developed the GitDigital Compliance SDK, an institutional-grade toolkit built specifically for Token-2022 Transfer Hooks. We’ve moved beyond simple whitelists to a Jurisdictional Bitmask Engine and Auto-Sanctioning AI that:
Automates Regional Compliance: US, EU (MiCA), and Asia logic enforced at the protocol level.
Deploys "Shielded" Assets: Real-time integration with risk oracles (Range/Switchboard) to block bad actors in <200ms.
Generates Audit-Ready Reports: One-click PDF exports for SEC/FINRA inquiries.
We’re helping projects move from "beta" to "institutional" by automating the gatekeeper. I’d love to show you how you can integrate our AI Shield into your next mint in under 10 minutes.
Do you have 15 minutes next Tuesday or Wednesday to see a quick demo of the Dashboard?
Best,
[Richard Kindler](A.K.A. RickCreator87)
