 ## Verify Address

-Users self-verify their wallet by signing a transaction:
-
-```bash
-anchor test -- --test verify-address
-```
-
-This creates a VerifiedAddress PDA owned by the user.
-
+Registry authorities verify addresses. The user being verified is a non-signer; the registry authority signs and pays for the PDA creation.
+
+Example:
+
+```typescript
+await program.methods.verifyAddress(metadataBytes).accounts({
+  user: userPublicKey,
+  registry: registryPda,
+  verifiedAddress: verifiedPda,
+  registryAuthority: wallet.publicKey,
+  systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
+}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();
+```
+
+This creates a `VerifiedAddress` PDA linked to the user, registered under that `registry`.
