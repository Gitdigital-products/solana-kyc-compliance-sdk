Key Configuration Files Needed

Based on the repository's history, these files are relevant for PR review requirements:

1. Branch Protection Rules

The repository has existing branch protection files. You should check and configure these in your GitHub repository settings under "Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules."

2. CODEOWNERS File (.github/CODEOWNERS)

This file specifies who must review specific code areas. Create this file with content like:

```
* @RickCreator87 @Gitdigital-products
/program/ @RickCreator87
/sdk/ @RickCreator87
/registry/ @Gitdigital-products
```

3. Pull Request Template (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

The repository already has this based on the file list. Ensure it includes sections for:

· Description of changes
· Testing performed
· Required approvals checklist
· Compliance verification

4. Required Status Checks (in GitHub Settings)

Configure these in your GitHub repository settings:

· Require status checks to pass before merging
· Require branches to be up to date before merging
· Require approvals from code owners

Immediate Steps to Configure

1. Enable GitHub Settings:
   · Go to your repository Settings → Branches
   · Add branch protection rule for main branch
   · Enable: "Require a pull request before merging"
   · Enable: "Require approvals" (1 or more reviewers)
   · Enable: "Require status checks" (cargo test, npm test, cargo fmt, cargo clippy)
2. Set Up Status Checks:
   Ensure your CI workflow (.github/workflows/CI.yml) includes the mandatory steps mentioned:
   · cargo test (Rust)
   · npm test (TypeScript)
   · cargo fmt --check
   · cargo clippy
   · Security audit step
3. Configure CODEOWNERS:
   Create the .github/CODEOWNERS file to automatically request reviews from the tech lead (@RickCreator87) for technical changes.
