To turn this SDK into a full-scale business, you need to stop selling "code" and start selling "Regulated Infrastructure." In 2026, the Solana RWA market is breaking records (surpassing $1.6B in value), and institutions are paying $20k–$50k just for initial audits and setups. Your "Money Maker" is positioned to capture this recurring revenue.
1. The 2026 Pricing Page Structure
Institutions prefer "Predictable Base + Usage Upside." Here is your commercial model:

| Plan | Target | Pricing | Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| Developer | Startups / Hackathons | Free / Open Source | Core Transfer Hook, Identity Manager SDK. |
| Pro | Emerging RWA Projects | $499 / Month | Risk Reporting Engine, 24/7 Monitoring, Slack Alerts. |
| Enterprise | Banks / PE Funds | $2,500+ / Month | Auto-Sanctioning AI, Custom Jurisdictional Logic, Dedicated Support. |
| Institutional | Global Issuers | Quote + 5bps AUM | White-label UI, SOC2 Compliance Exports, Multi-sig Recovery Suite. |

2. The Pitch Deck Outline
If you're presenting this to investors or partners, follow this "6-Slide" flow:
 * The Hook (The Problem): "Institutional capital is ready for Solana, but $1.6B in RWAs is at risk without protocol-level compliance. Manual whitelisting doesn't scale."
 * The Solution: "GitDigital: The first AI-driven, multi-jurisdictional compliance layer for Solana Token-2022."
 * The Tech (The Moat): Show the Jurisdictional Bitmask and Transfer Hook logic. Explain how it’s immutable and audit-ready.
 * The "Shield" (AI): Detail the Auto-Sanctioning AI. "We block bad actors in <400ms—faster than any human compliance officer."
 * Traction/Market: "Solana RWA value is up 200% this year. We are the 'Stripe for Regulated Assets'."
 * The Ask: "Partnering with us to secure the next $1B in tokenized assets."
