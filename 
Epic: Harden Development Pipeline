Below is a summary of the proposed files and their key purposes.

File: .github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml
Purpose:The main CI/CD pipeline that runs on every pull request and push to main and staging. It ensures all code passes tests, formatting, linting, and security audits before merging.
Core Actions:

· Runs cargo test, npm test, cargo fmt --check, and cargo clippy
· Executes security audits for dependencies (Rust/JS)
· Builds the project in release mode

File: .github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml
Purpose:Advanced static analysis to detect security vulnerabilities in both Rust and TypeScript/JavaScript code. Runs weekly and on pushes to main.
Core Actions:

· Initializes CodeQL for the repository
· Performs an automated security scan across all code
· Uploads results for review

File: .github/workflows/anchor-tests.yml
Purpose:A specialized workflow to build and test the on-chain Anchor program (Rust), which is critical for the Solana smart contract.
Core Actions:

· Sets up Solana and Anchor test environments
· Runs anchor test for on-chain program validation
· Ensures program compiles correctly

File: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md
Purpose:Standardizes the PR review process to ensure quality and comprehensive testing. This template guides contributors on what to check before merging.
Core Checks:

· Confirms all CI checks pass
· Requires updates to tests and documentation
· Mandates no new security warnings from scans

File: .github/dependabot.yml
Purpose:Automates dependency updates to proactively patch security vulnerabilities in both npm and Cargo packages.
Core Actions:

· Weekly scans for updates in /sdk/ (npm) and /program/ (Cargo)
· Opens automated pull requests for new versions
· Helps maintain a secure supply chain

File: .gitleaks.toml
Purpose:Prevents accidental commits of secrets (like private keys, API tokens) to the repository by scanning every commit.
Core Rules:

· Detects Solana private key patterns
· Flags common API key formats
· Scans for high-entropy strings

File: SECURITY.md
Purpose:Provides a clear, public policy for reporting security vulnerabilities, establishing a professional and secure channel for disclosures.
Key Elements:

· Points of contact for security issues
· Acknowledgment policy for reporters
· Link to the GitHub Security Advisory system

📁 How to Implement These Files

To implement this hardened pipeline, please follow these steps:

1. Create the Directory Structure: First, ensure the required .github directories exist in your repository's root.
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE
   ```
2. Add the Workflow Files: Copy the content for each .yml file (like ci-pipeline.yml) into the .github/workflows/ directory.
3. Add the Template and Config Files: Place the pull_request_template.md in its directory and the dependabot.yml and gitleaks.toml files in the .github/ and root directories, respectively.
4. Commit and Push: Add these files to git, commit with a message like "feat: harden CI/CD pipeline with quality and security gates", and push to your repository.
5. Verify in GitHub: Go to your repository on GitHub. You should see the new workflows under the "Actions" tab and the pull request template will be active when creating a new PR.

🔐 Key Outcomes for Your Epic

These files work together to deliver the "No compromises on enterprise-grade delivery" goal:

· Automated Quality Gates: Every code change is automatically tested, linted, and checked for style.
· Proactive Security: Regular scans for vulnerabilities in both code and dependencies, plus prevention of secrets leakage.
· Standardized Process: A clear checklist for contributors and maintainers ensures consistent quality in every merge.
· Comprehensive Coverage: The pipeline covers the full stack—Rust on-chain programs, TypeScript SDK, and related tooling.
