4. Review Requirement Workflow (.github/workflows/require-reviews.yml)

Create this workflow to enforce review requirements:

```yaml
name: Enforce Review Requirements

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  check-reviews:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check for required reviewers
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const requiredTeams = ['Gitdigital-products'];
            const requiredUsers = ['RickCreator87'];
            
            const reviews = await github.rest.pulls.listReviews({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              pull_number: context.payload.pull_request.number
            });
            
            const approvedUsers = new Set();
            const approvedTeams = new Set();
            
            reviews.data.forEach(review => {
              if (review.state === 'APPROVED') {
                approvedUsers.add(review.user.login);
              }
            });
            
            // Check for team approvals (simplified - GitHub handles this natively)
            const hasTechLead = requiredUsers.some(user => approvedUsers.has(user));
            const missingReviews = [];
            
            if (!hasTechLead) {
              missingReviews.push('@RickCreator87 (Tech Lead)');
            }
            
            if (missingReviews.length > 0) {
              core.setFailed(`Missing required reviews from: ${missingReviews.join(', ')}`);
