## Solana KYC Compliance SDK  
### Compliance, Security & Trust Framework

This document defines the security, compliance, resilience, and trust posture of the **Solana KYC Compliance SDK** developed by **GitDigital Products**.

It is intended for developers, customers, auditors, partners, and regulators reviewing the SDK.

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

The Solana KYC Compliance SDK provides tooling to support identity verification, compliance workflows, and audit logging for applications built on the Solana blockchain.

GitDigital Products:
- Provides **software tooling only**
- Does **not** custody funds
- Does **not** act as a financial institution
- Does **not** provide legal or regulatory advice

This framework applies to:
- The Solana KYC Compliance SDK
- Supporting APIs and services
- Compliance and audit logging mechanisms
- Operational infrastructure

---

## 2. Design Philosophy

- **SDK, not custodian**  
  Customers retain control of data flow and regulatory obligations.

- **Compliance-aware, not compliance-blocking**  
  Designed to integrate with KYC/AML processes without degrading user experience.

- **Blockchain-native**  
  Built with Solana’s execution model, RPC dependencies, and ecosystem risks in mind.

- **Audit-ready by default**  
  Logging, controls, and documentation are first-class features.
