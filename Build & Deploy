Run these commands from your project root directory:

1. Build the program:
   ```bash
   anchor build
   ``
   This compiles your Rust code and produces a new target/ directory with a .so file.
2. Deploy to Devnet:
   ```bash
   anchor deploy
   ``
   This command will:
   · Deploy the .so file to the Devnet cluster.
   · Output a new Program ID (e.g., Fg6PaF...). Copy this ID immediately.

Step 3: Verify and Update Configuration

1. Verify: Paste your new Program ID into a Devnet explorer like Solscan (Devnet). You should see your program account.
2. Update Anchor.toml: Replace the placeholder ID with your new, real one.
   ```toml
   [programs.devnet]
   solana_kyc_compliance = "YOUR_NEW_PROGRAM_ID_HERE"
   ``
3. Re-build and sync: Run anchor build again. This ensures your TypeScript client library (IDL) knows the correct address.
