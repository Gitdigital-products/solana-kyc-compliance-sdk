One-command sandbox  
- `pnpm create solana-kyc-app` → scaffolds:  
  – localvalidator with the two programs deployed,  
  – 3 pre-funded keypairs (super-admin, provider, user),  
  – a NextJS mini-dapp that lets you drag-and-drop a passport image and see the KYC level update in real time.

SDK monorepo layout

- Add a GitHub workflow that publishes `@solana-kyc/sdk` to npm & PyPI on every semver tag.

Docs portal  
- Use VitePress or Docusaurus.  
- Auto-generate an API page from the IDL (anchor-cli has a `--docs` flag).  
- Add three “recipes”:  
  – “Gate a Metaplex NFT mint with KYC level ≥ 2.”  
  – “Allow SPL transfers only between KYC-verified wallets.”  
  – “Run a permissioned AMM pool.”
