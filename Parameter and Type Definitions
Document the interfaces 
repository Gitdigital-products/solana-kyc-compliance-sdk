Phase 1 Task 1
Create comprehensive documentation for all TypeScript SDK functions, classes, and parameters that will be exposed in v1.0. This serves as the contract for developers.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

List all public functions in /sdk/src/lib.ts with JSDoc comments
Define parameter types, return types, and error states for each function
Include 2-3 code usage examples for key flows (initialize compliance, check transfer status)
Document required Solana wallet connections and network configurations
Create API.md file in /docs/ directory with all above information
TECHNICAL NOTES:

Focus on the Transfer Hook integration flow first
Use TypeScript interface definitions as source of truth
Consider generating reference docs automatically with TypeDoc later

To help you create the API documentation, I've analyzed the technical notes for the SDK you're working on. The SDK is part of the solana-kyc-compliance-sdk project, and its core functionality revolves around the Solana Token 2022 Transfer Hook extension for enforcing compliance rules.

Based on the search results, here is a breakdown of the core concepts and a suggested structure for your API documentation, complete with example code blocks.

🔗 Understanding the Transfer Hook Context

The TypeScript SDK you are documenting is a client library for a Solana Transfer Hook program. This means every token transfer will automatically call (CPI) into a custom program you've built to enforce rules. The key concepts you must document are:

· ExtraAccountMetaList: A required PDA account that stores a list of any additional accounts your hook logic needs to function. Its address is derived from the mint address and your program ID.

· Hook Execution: The custom logic (e.g., KYC checks) runs during the transfer. If it fails, the entire token transfer is rolled back.

· Wallet & Network: All SDK functions will require a connection to a Solana network (e.g., devnet, mainnet-beta) and a signer (wallet) to pay fees and sign transactions.

📄 Suggested Structure for /docs/API.md

Here is a practical outline and content you can adapt to create your API.md file.

Introduction and Overview
Start by explaining the SDK's purpose:to provide a TypeScript/JavaScript interface for initializing and interacting with KYC-compliant tokens using Solana's Transfer Hook extension.

Core SDK Interface (ComplianceSDK)
Define the main class that will be instantiated with required configuration.Use TypeScript interfaces as the source of truth per your technical notes.

import { Connection, PublicKey, Signer } from '@solana/web3.js';

/**
 * Configuration required to initialize the Compliance SDK.
 * @interface ComplianceSdkConfig
 */
interface ComplianceSdkConfig {
  /** Connection to the Solana cluster (e.g., devnet, mainnet-beta) */
  connection: Connection;
  /** The program ID (address) of the deployed Transfer Hook program */
  programId: PublicKey;
  /** The Token Program ID (should be `TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID`) */
  tokenProgramId?: PublicKey;
}

/**
 * Main SDK class for KYC compliance operations on Solana.
 * Provides methods to initialize compliant mints and execute verified transfers.
 * @class ComplianceSDK
 */
export class ComplianceSDK {
  constructor(config: ComplianceSdkConfig);
  // ... public methods documented below
}
Public Function Documentation
List and document each public function from/sdk/src/lib.ts. The examples below focus on the two key flows mentioned in your acceptance criteria.
· Function 1: initializeCompliantMint

/**
 * Creates a new token mint with the Transfer Hook extension enabled for compliance.
 * This mint will invoke the hook program on every transfer.
 * @param {InitializeCompliantMintParams} params - Parameters for mint creation.
 * @returns {Promise<TransactionSignature>} The transaction signature of the mint creation.
 * @throws {WalletNotConnectedError} If no payer is connected.
 * @throws {TransactionFailedError} If the blockchain transaction fails.
 */
async initializeCompliantMint(
  params: InitializeCompliantMintParams
): Promise<TransactionSignature>;
· Function 2: createExtraAccountMetaList

/**
 * Initializes the required ExtraAccountMetaList PDA for the Transfer Hook.
 * This account must be created before transfers can succeed.
 * @param {PublicKey} mint - The public key of the compliant mint.
 * @param {Signer} payer - The signer responsible for paying transaction fees.
 * @returns {Promise<TransactionSignature>} The transaction signature.
 */
async createExtraAccountMetaList(
  mint: PublicKey,
  payer: Signer
): Promise<TransactionSignature>;
· Function 3: transferCheckedWithHook

/**
 * Executes a token transfer that will be validated by the compliance hook.
 * This is the primary method for moving compliant tokens between wallets.
 * @param {TransferCheckedWithHookParams} params - Transfer parameters.
 * @returns {Promise<TransactionSignature>} The transaction signature of the transfer.
 * @throws {TransferDeniedByHookError} If the hook program rejects the transfer (e.g., KYC failure).
 */
async transferCheckedWithHook(
  params: TransferCheckedWithHookParams
): Promise<TransactionSignature>;
Parameter and Type Definitions
Document the interfaces used by the functions above.Structure this as a clear list instead of a table for better mobile readability.
Interface: InitializeCompliantMintParams

· payer (Signer): The wallet that pays for and signs the mint creation transaction.

· mintAuthority (PublicKey): The public key that will have authority over the new mint.

· freezeAuthority (PublicKey | null): The freeze authority for the mint, if any.

· decimals (number): The number of decimal places for the token.

· initialKycData (object): Initial data required for the compliance hook.

Interface: TransferCheckedWithHookParams

· source (PublicKey): The source token account address.

· mint (PublicKey): The mint address of the token.

· destination (PublicKey): The destination token account address.

· owner (Signer): The owner and signer of the source token account.

· amount (number | bigint): The amount of tokens to transfer.

· kycProof (object[]): An array of proofs or signatures required to pass the hook's KYC check.
