✅ Full Proposal Document Checklist: Solana RWA Compliance SDK
Section 1: Project Overview & Abstract (The Hook)
Item
Description
Status
Project Title
Clear, specific, and descriptive title. (e.g., Solana Token Extensions KYC Compliance SDK: Accelerating Institutional RWA Adoption)
\Box
Abstract / Executive Summary
Crucial: 150–250 word summary covering the problem, solution, impact, and total funding request (\$84,000).
\Box
Project Team
List of core team members (Project Lead, SPE, SIE, JD) and a one-sentence role description for each.
\Box
Requested Funding
Total grant amount requested and the intended duration (3 months).
\Box
 
Section 2: Problem & Solution (The Why)
Item
Description
Status
Detailed Problem Statement
Expands on the email: The current lack of a simple, compliant, and open-source tool for RWA issuers using Token Extensions.
\Box
Target Audience
Clearly define who benefits (e.g., Institutional RWA issuers, compliance vendors, and DeFi protocols seeking compliant liquidity).
\Box
Proposed Solution (Detailed)
In-depth description of the SDK, focusing on the three components: Transfer Hook Module, Compliance Registry Program (CRP), and Vendor Abstraction.
\Box
Technical Stack
List of technologies: Rust, Anchor, Solana CLI, TypeScript, web3.js, NPM, and chosen data structures.
\Box
Competitive Analysis
Briefly explain why existing solutions (or custom smart contracts) are inadequate compared to the native, standardized Token Extensions approach.
\Box
 
Section 3: Scope, Deliverables, and Timeline (The What and When)
Item
Description
Status
Detailed Deliverables by Milestone
Finalized table from our previous discussion (M1, M2, M3) with clear, quantifiable metrics (e.g., CRP deployed to mainnet beta, 80% test coverage).
\Box
Open-Source Licensing
Commitment to release all code under a permissive license (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0). Foundations require this.
\Box
Future Maintenance Plan
A brief plan for how the SDK will be maintained and governed after the grant period (e.g., Community contribution model, potential DAO formation).
\Box
Success Metrics (KPIs)
How the Foundation can measure success (e.g., Number of token projects using the SDK, developer downloads, adoption by a major RWA issuer).
\Box
 
Section 4: Budget & Team Justification (The How Much)
Item
Description
Status
Detailed Budget Breakdown
The finalized table listing Personnel, Infrastructure, and Audit costs (\$84,000).
\Box
Budget Justification
Clear, two-sentence rationale for the cost of each major item (e.g., SPE cost is high due to specialized Rust/Anchor expertise required for on-chain security).
\Box
Team Portfolio & Experience
Brief (2-3 sentence) bios for the Project Lead and two Senior Engineers (SPE, SIE), highlighting relevant experience (Rust, TypeScript, Solana, security).
\Box
 
Section 5: Appendix (Supporting Material)
Item
Description
Status
GitHub Repository Link
Link to the public project repository (even if it's currently just the basic README.md and initial setup).
\Box
Team Member LinkedIns/CVs
Links to professional profiles for key personnel.
\Box
Mockups/Diagrams
A simple block diagram illustrating how the SDK sits between the RWA Issuer, the Token Extensions, and the Compliance Vendor API. Highly recommended.
