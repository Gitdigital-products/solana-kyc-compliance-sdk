Security Best Practices

For Developers

1. Key Management
   ```bash
   # Use hardware wallets for admin keys
   # Implement multi-sig for critical operations
   # Never commit private keys to repositories
   ```
2. Code Security
   ```typescript
   // Validate all inputs
   // Use PDAs for account security
   // Implement proper access controls
   // Follow the principle of least privilege
   ```
3. Dependencies
   ```bash
   # Regularly update dependencies
   # Audit third-party packages
   # Use lock files (package-lock.json, Cargo.lock)
   ```

For Users

1. Administration
   · Use multi-sig wallets for admin authority
   · Regularly rotate admin keys
   · Monitor for suspicious activity
   · Keep backups of critical data
2. Integration
   · Validate all on-chain data
   · Implement rate limiting
   · Monitor transaction failures
   · Keep audit logs
3. Operations
   · Regular security audits
   · Incident response plan
   · Employee security training
   · Compliance with regulations

Security Features

   · All critical accounts are PDAs
   · No arbitrary account creation
   · Deterministic address generation
2. Access Control
   · Admin-only functions protected
   · Multi-sig support
   · Role-based permissions
3. Input Validation
   · All inputs validated on-chain
   · Size limits and format checks
   · Malicious input rejection

Token Extensions Security

1. Transfer Hook
   · Only called by Token Program
   · Validated execution context
   · No mint authority exposure
2. Permanent Delegate
