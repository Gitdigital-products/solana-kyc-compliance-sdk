2️⃣ Architecture Diagram (Mermaid – zero friction)

Drop this into docs/architecture.md or a new file:
docs/architecture-diagram.md

GitHub renders Mermaid natively. No images required.

### Why this slaps
- Auditors instantly understand scope
- Devs instantly understand flow
- Investors instantly understand moat

No explanation needed beyond the diagram.

## 3️⃣ Audit-Readiness Checklist (this is the big one)

Create:  
📄 `docs/audit-readiness.md`

This does two things:
- Makes auditors faster
- Makes *you* calmer

# Audit Readiness Checklist

This document outlines the security posture and expectations for the Solana KYC Compliance SDK.

---

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- On-chain compliance programs
- Registry state management
- Attestation verification
- Transfer enforcement logic

### Out of Scope
- Off-chain KYC providers
- Risk scoring algorithms
- Identity verification processes

---

## Security Assumptions

- Registry authority is trusted and multisig-controlled
- Attestation issuer keys are protected
- Off-chain services are independently secured

---

## On-Chain Controls

- [ ] All instructions validate signer authority
- [ ] PDA seeds are deterministic and documented
- [ ] No unchecked account writes
- [ ] No PII stored on-chain
- [ ] Explicit error handling for all failure paths

---

## Enforcement Guarantees

- [ ] Non-compliant transfers revert
- [ ] Expired attestations are rejected
- [ ] Revocations apply immediately
- [ ] Freeze state is enforced across all paths

---

## Upgrade & Governance

- [ ] Program upgrade authority documented
- [ ] Recommended multisig configuration provided
- [ ] Upgrade path documented for breaking changes

---

## Testing Coverage

- [ ] Unit tests for all instructions
- [ ] Negative tests for enforcement failures
- [ ] Integration tests for SDK flows
- [ ] Devnet deployment verified

---

## Known Risks

- Off-chain provider compromise
- Registry authority compromise
- Incorrect risk scoring inputs

Mitigations are documented but not enforced on-chain.

## Audit Notes

This project enforces compliance outcomes, not identity verification.
All sensitive processes occur off-chain.
