✓ Adapter must run in the **restricted** k8s namespace (network policies already block outbound except to your core API)  
✓ All traffic is mTLS; the platform presents a client cert with CN=`compliance.ourplatform`  
✓ PII is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and automatically deleted after 90 days or on account deletion—no action needed  
✓ Log only `applicantId` and `providerReference`; never log full names or images  
✓ Pen-test report & SOC-2 letter must be uploaded before “Enabled for Production” toggle is available
